When building applications that integrate externally, you're exposing the application to external windows where
information will be sent to and from channels.

It's recommended that your application authenticates the calls made.

This repository will cover three authentication methods:
- Auth Code Grant - This method is a multi-step secure OAuth solution that is typically integrated into web application scenarios. This typical flow of Auth Code Grant involves multiple steps that result in obtaining an access token. This flow is typically used when a user is present to take action. If you want a more automated approach you should explore using a JSON Web Token (JWT) grant instead.
- Implicit Grant
- JWT (JSON Wed Token) Grant
