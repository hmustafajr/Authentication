The primary use of the Implicit Grant method is to provide an OAuth solution for native mobile applications.
Applications using Implicit Grant have a similar workflow to the Auth Code Grant, except they are not required to get an authorization code to retrieve an access token.
Access tokens are administered upon request at the authentication endpoint.
To complete the flow you must have:
- An integrator key
- A secret key
- A redirect URI
- Note in some scenarios you will be prompted and have to confirm that ‘this is a mobile application’

During the initial authentication attempt the user is prompted to give the mobile application permission to run operations.
Once permission has been granted, the mobile app can make requests for access tokens without the need for an authorization code, this also applies to future calls.
Your application should include a mechanism to check if the current access code is expired, and if so, make a request to get a new one.

Refresh tokens aren't necessary for the Implicit Grant flow because the app can make an implicit call to obtain a new access token without the need for this parameter included in the request.
