The primary use of Auth Code Grant is to authenticate a user application that's running on the web and where a user interfaces with the application.

This is typically used for applications that are authenticating each user on an individual basis.

To complete the flow you must have:
- An Integrator Key (iKey)
- A Secret Key
- Redirect URI

The Auth Code Grant method is primarily used for web apps that have a user interface and require the user to take action on something.

The flow consists of building a request using the iKey and secret key to an endpoint. If valid the service authorizes the request and then redirects back to a predetermined URI
It also returns a query string code variable that contains an authorization code.
- This code is then used to make a second request that returns the JSON that contains an access token and refresh token

Finally, you use the access token to retreive data or access resources. If the access token expires the refresh token can be used in another request to retrieve a new access token.
- Refresh tokens are good for 30 days.
